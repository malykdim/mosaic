## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Vue Router** handles public pages (Home, Gallery, Login) and protected admin routes.
- **Pinia Stores** centralize logic:
  - `useUserStore` for authentication/session
  - `useItem` for item creation workflow
  - `useStorage` for file upload + public URL generation
  - `useCollection` for CRUD operations
  - `useGalleryListener` for real-time sync

- **Global Components**: Navigation, Footer, NotFound
- **SCSS Modules**: Maintain modular and themeable styles with global variables and utility classes.

- User registration and login with Supabase Auth
- Artwork upload with live image previews
- Real-time gallery updates (insert/update/delete)
